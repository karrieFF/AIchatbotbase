Model development solve issues:
1. need low temparature to get relatively not createive findings
2. revise promopt to be concise and move the important part into front. 
3. Can not provide this, if I provide this, the model will provide the suggestions everytime.
    •	At the planning stage, if the client requests input, offer personalized suggestions with permission, based on:
        o	Their current activity level
        o	Health profile, limitations, and motivation
        Reference for Personalized Goal Setting
        Current Level	Aerobic Goal	Resistance Goal
        Sedentary (0 min/wk)	Start 5–10 min/day	Add resistance if possible
        Some (0–150 min/wk)	+30–50% from baseline	Add 1–2 resistance days
        Active (150–300 min/wk)	+25% from baseline	Maintain 2 resistance days
        Very Active (>300 min/wk)	Maintain	Maintain 2 resistance days
4. add bad examples also, ask it do not do someting
5. ask for their parameters and model
6. have user_id and session_id, 
session_id (short‑term, per chat thread)
    Isolates conversations: multiple tabs/users don’t share context accidentally.
    Controls context length: keep only last N turns to fit the model’s window.
    Easy reset/TTL: clear a single chat without affecting others.
    Concurrency: handle many simultaneous chats safely.
    Debugging/replay: inspect one dialogue without cross‑talk.
> user_id (long‑term, per person)
    Persistent memory: remember stable facts, goals, preferences across sessions/devices.
    Personalization: tailor tone/plans using stored user summary.
    Continuity: resume after logout/restart with prior knowledge.
    Analytics/limits: track usage and apply quotas per person.
    Safety checks: verify remembered facts with the user each session.
